## Chillin

Iâ€™m in high school, and I spend 5-8 hours programming per day. I know Python really well, I can get stuff done in Javascript and AHK, currently learning Arduino and C++. I don't know what I want to do for a job, but I want to do some sort of programming. I also want to do some uni courses on programming, but I'm years too young for any of them, despite being at their level.

Would love to chat with anyone who has any tips about learning programming whatsoever. Send me an email, and I will reply.
