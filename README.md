## Not really sure where my life is going honestly. Could really use some help?

Iâ€™m in high school, and I spend 3-6 hours programming per day. I know Python really well, I can get stuff done in Javascript, currently learning Arduino, maybe I'll move onto C. I don't know what I want to do for a job, but some sort of programming.
