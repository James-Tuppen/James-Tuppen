## Not really sure where my life is going honestly. Could really use some help?

I’m in high school, and I spend 3-6 hours programming per day. I know Python really well, I can get stuff done in Javascript, currently learning Arduino, maybe I'll move onto C. I don't know what I want to do for a job, but I want to do some sort of programming.

The main issues I have are:
- I am not sure what language I should learn
- Although I know JavaScript, I can’t use it practically (eg. I can’t make a website, but I can use it to edit a website via DevTools)
- I have an extremely slow PC, and I do not have any good tools for code editing. (I have VSCode, but I do not know how to use it to easily make CSS code or a website) Am I supposed to code in it and paste into a website’s code, or can I automate or integrate something so my code automatically runs on the website?

In short, I could do with talking to someone who has more experience than me for even just 30 minutes. Looking for a friend here.
