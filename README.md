## Currently got life on the rails, I guess.

Iâ€™m in high school, and I spend 3-6 hours programming per day. I know Python really well, I can get stuff done in Javascript and AHK, currently learning Arduino and C++. I don't know what I want to do for a job, but I want to do some sort of programming.

Would love to chat with anyone who has any tips about learning programming whatsoever. Send me an email, and I will reply quickly.
